        <ol>
            <li>
                Remove steak from package, pat dry, and place on a plate. 
                Refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 hours before cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. 
                Sprinkle steak thoroughly with salt and pepper. 
                Trim off any extra fat from steak. 
                Place steak in skillet with fattest side down; 
                cook until fat is browned, about 2 minutes. 
                Continue cooking until steak is browned, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add butter to skillet and cook until butter is browned. 
                Turn steak over and cook, basting with browned butter, for 2 minutes more. 
                Remove from skillet to a plate. 
                Tent with foil, and rest steak for 7 minutes to absorb juice. 
                Serve steak with a pat of butter.
