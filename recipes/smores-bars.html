    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>
        This is a great, quick recipe for a very sweet treat - no measuring involved! 
        This is so easy to play with. You could make your crust out of chocolate grahams, 
        or add any extra little sweetness you would like.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 individual packages graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) bag chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) package butterscotch chips</li>
        <li>½ (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows</li>
        <li>½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease an 8x8-inch square pan with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix melted butter and graham cracker crumbs together; 
            press into an even layer at the bottom of the pan. 
            Top with chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and marshmallows. 
            Drizzle sweetened condensed milk on top.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 17 to 20 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Let cool, about 30 minutes. To make it easier to cut into bars, 
            cover with plastic wrap and chill, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
